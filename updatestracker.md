- **expenses**: `id`, `trip_id`, `name`, `merchant_name`, `total_amount`, `currency`, `receipt_image_url`, `expense_date`, `paid_by`, `category`, `summary`, `emoji`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **expense_items**: `id`, `expense_id`, `name`, `price`, `quantity`, `item_order`, `created_at`
- **item_assignments**: `id`, `expense_item_id`, `user_id`, `assigned_at`

### Database Implementation:
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Complete database functions for all entities
- **Comprehensive API**: 8 API endpoints for complete functionality
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and validation
- **Performance**: Proper indexes and optimized queries
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

### API Endpoints Created:
- `POST /api/users` - Create/get user by username
- `POST /api/trips` - Create trip (returns random 3-digit code)
- `GET /api/trips/[code]` - Get trip info by code
- `POST /api/trips/[code]/join` - Join trip with code
- `POST /api/trips/[code]/expenses` - Add expenses with items
- `POST /api/expenses/[id]/items/assign` - Assign items to users
- `GET /api/test-new-db` - Complete system test
- `GET /api/debug-db` - Debug database state

### Major Issue & Resolution:
- **Schema Mismatch**: Old trips table had wrong schema (members array, total_expenses, etc.)
- **Database Reset**: Created `/api/reset-db` endpoint to drop all tables and recreate
- **Fresh Start**: Successfully reset database with correct new schema
- **Full Testing**: Verified all operations work correctly

### Testing Results:
- ✅ **Database Connection**: Working
- ✅ **User Creation**: `alice`, `bob`, `testuser1`, `testuser2` created
- ✅ **Trip Creation**: Trip code 602 (Paris Trip) and 574 (Tokyo Trip) generated
- ✅ **Trip Joining**: Users can join trips via 3-digit codes
- ✅ **Member Management**: Trip members tracked correctly
- ✅ **Expense Creation**: Expenses with items saved successfully
- ✅ **Item Assignment**: Item-level assignments working

### New User Flow:
1. **User Creation**: Enter username → instant account creation
2. **Trip Creation**: Create trip → get 3-digit code (e.g., 602)
3. **Trip Sharing**: Share code with friends
4. **Trip Joining**: Enter code → instantly join trip
5. **Receipt Scanning**: Scan receipt → AI extracts items
6. **Item Assignment**: Pick which items each person ordered
7. **Real-Time Sync**: All members see updates instantly

### Technical Stack:
- **Database**: Vercel Neon PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: `@vercel/postgres` with SQL template literals
- **Authentication**: Username-only (no passwords)
- **Real-Time**: Database-backed with instant updates

## Update #24: Enhanced JSON Parsing - Trailing Comma Bug Fix
**Date**: 2024-12-28  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Changes Made:
- **Robust Trailing Comma Handling**: Enhanced JSON parsing to properly handle trailing commas in OpenAI responses
- **Multiple Fallback Strategies**: Implemented comprehensive error handling for malformed JSON responses
- **Improved Regex Cleaning**: Enhanced regex patterns to catch and remove trailing commas before closing braces and brackets
- **Better Error Logging**: Added detailed error messages showing exact parse position and content for debugging
- **Production Stability**: Ensured receipt scanning continues working even with malformed OpenAI responses

### Bug Fixed:
- **Trailing Comma Issue**: OpenAI occasionally returned JSON with trailing commas (e.g., `"quantity": 1,}`) which broke `JSON.parse()`
- **Parse Error**: `SyntaxError: Expected double-quoted property name in JSON at position 417`
- **Specific Case**: Trailing comma after `"quantity": 1,` in items array caused parsing failure

### Technical Enhancements:
- **Enhanced Regex Patterns**: Improved trailing comma removal with more comprehensive regex matching
- **Fallback Parsing**: Multiple parsing attempts with different cleaning strategies
- **Error Context**: Better error reporting showing exact position and content of parsing failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to mock responses when all parsing attempts fail

### Files Modified:
- `app/api/scan-receipt/route.ts` - Enhanced JSON parsing with improved trailing comma handling and error recovery

## Update #25: Increased Recent Expenses Display
**Date**: 2024-12-28  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Changes Made:
- **More Recent Items**: Increased recent expenses display from 3 to 6 items on homepage
- **Better Space Utilization**: Better use of available screen space between Recent section and bottom navigation
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can now see more recent expenses at a glance without needing to navigate to "View all"

### Technical Changes:
- Updated `getRecentExpenses(trip.id, 3)` to `getRecentExpenses(trip.id, 6)`
- Maintained same responsive design and card styling
- No layout changes needed - existing design handles additional items gracefully

### Visual Improvements:
- **Better Screen Usage**: Fills empty space between Recent section and bottom navigation
- **More Information**: Users can see twice as many recent expenses on the main screen
- **Consistent Design**: All expense cards maintain the same visual style and category colors

### Files Modified:
- `app/page.tsx` - Increased recent expenses limit from 3 to 6 items

## Update #26: Gitignore Refinement - Environment Files
**Date**: 2024-12-28  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Changes Made:
- **More Specific Environment File Handling**: Refined `.gitignore` to be more selective about which environment files to ignore
- **Lock File Confirmation**: Confirmed `pnpm-lock.yaml` is correctly **not** in `.gitignore` (lock files should be committed)
- **Better Environment Management**: Only ignore local environment files while allowing shared ones to be committed

### Previous Issue:
- **Too Broad**: `.env*` pattern ignored all environment files including shared ones like `.env.development`
- **Lost Flexibility**: Shared environment configurations couldn't be committed to version control

### Improved Pattern:
- **Specific Local Files**: `.env.local`, `.env*.local` patterns only ignore local overrides
- **Shared Files Allowed**: `.env.development`, `.env.production`, `.env.test` can be committed
- **Template Files Allowed**: Base `.env` files can be committed as templates

### Benefits:
- **Team Consistency**: Shared environment configurations can be version controlled
- **Security**: Local files with secrets remain ignored
- **Flexibility**: Different environments can have committed base configurations

### Files Modified:
- `.gitignore` - Refined environment file patterns for better specificity
