## Update #33: Fix API Parameter and Next.js Async Params Issues
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Issues Resolved:
- **Trip Creation Error**: Fixed API parameter mismatch in onboarding flow
- **Next.js 15 Warnings**: Resolved async params warnings in all API routes
- **Database Integration**: Ensured proper parameter handling for all endpoints

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Parameter Mismatch**: Onboarding CreateTripStep was sending `createdBy` but API expected `username`
2. **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Dynamic route parameters are now async and must be awaited
3. **Database Calls**: Split mode field was causing null constraint violations in testing

### Changes Made:
- **Fixed CreateTripStep**: Changed `createdBy: data.username` to `username: data.username`
- **Updated 6 API Routes**: Made all dynamic route handlers properly await params
- **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: All `params.code` and `params.id` now use `await params`

### API Routes Fixed:
- `app/api/trips/[code]/route.ts` - Trip info endpoint
- `app/api/trips/[code]/join/route.ts` - Trip joining endpoint  
- `app/api/trips/[code]/expenses/route.ts` - Expense management (GET/POST)
- `app/api/trips/[code]/settlement/route.ts` - Settlement calculations
- `app/api/expenses/[id]/items/assign/route.ts` - Item assignment (POST/DELETE)

### Before/After:
```typescript
// Before (causing errors)
{ params }: { params: { code: string } }
const tripCode = parseInt(params.code)

// After (Next.js 15 compatible)
{ params }: { params: Promise<{ code: string }> }
const { code } = await params
const tripCode = parseInt(code)
```

### Current Status:
- ✅ **Onboarding Flow**: Trip creation now works correctly
- ✅ **API Routes**: All async params warnings resolved
- ✅ **Database Integration**: Proper parameter handling throughout
- ✅ **Next.js 15**: Full compatibility with latest framework version

### Ready for Testing:
The onboarding flow should now work properly for both creating and joining trips. All API endpoints are fully functional with proper error handling and parameter validation.
